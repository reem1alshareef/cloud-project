@uncriticalsimon @StarbucksUK I tend to go for Costa when given a choice but Starbucks is good if you're on a long journey. You can get a massive cup of coffee that lasts a good hour. You pay for it by having to stop again sooner though as what goes in must come out.

@tina0402x @Rossmac212 Costa is for people who like weak coffee and as a large has only 1 shot same as a medium you wouldn’t want it to be filled to the top or you wouldn’t taste the coffee at all. If you want anything from Costa that tastes of coffee go for a flat white.

@LozzaFox Have you noticed Costa coffee is having many issues with lack of staff. Even today a local Costa was closed due to sickness. Anecdotally it has something to do with franchise owners. Many paying less than minimum wage. You don’t get loyalty from undervalued staff.
