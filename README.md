Our project involves using machine learning techniques to analyze tweets about Costa Coffee from Twitter. We collect these tweets using the Twitter API, which allows us to access a large and diverse set of tweets in real-time. We then save these tweets in a dataset format that is suitable for machine learning.

Once we have collected a sufficient number of tweets, we apply various machine learning algorithms to gain insights from the data. For example, we might use sentiment analysis to determine whether the tweets are positive, negative, or neutral towards Costa Coffee. We might also use topic modeling to identify the most common topics that people are discussing in relation to Costa Coffee, such as the quality of the coffee, the service at the cafes, or the prices of the products.

By analyzing these tweets using machine learning techniques, we hope to gain a better understanding of users' opinions of Costa Coffee and to identify areas where the company can improve its products and services. This information can be valuable to Costa Coffee in a number of ways, such as by helping them to tailor their marketing campaigns, improve customer satisfaction, or develop new products that meet the needs of their customers.
